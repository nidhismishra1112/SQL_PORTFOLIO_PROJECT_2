# SQL_PORTFOLIO_PROJECT_2
Title: Data Cleaning in SQL: Portfolio Project for Data Analysis

Description:

In this SQL portfolio project, I have developed a comprehensive project focused on data cleaning techniques in SQL, with the aim of preparing the data for analysis. The project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL skills related to data cleaning, data transformation, and data quality management, by utilizing various SQL functions, queries, and techniques to clean and preprocess the data for effective analysis.

The project covers a wide range of data cleaning tasks using SQL, including handling date functions, auto-populating data, deleting unwanted columns, separating values into different columns using string functions, using CASE statements, and utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to delete duplicate values using window functions, among others.

The project may involve using SQL date functions,  to manipulate and standardize date data, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the data.

Various string functions, such as SUBSTRING and REPLACE, may be utilized to extract, concatenate, and manipulate string data to separate values into different columns, clean up inconsistent data, or standardize data format. 
The project may also involve deleting unwanted columns using SQL ALTER TABLE statements, DROP COLUMN statements, or data manipulation queries, depending on the requirements of the data analysis. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) may be used in combination with window functions, such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, or DENSE_RANK, to identify and delete duplicate values in the dataset, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

Overall, this SQL portfolio project showcases my ability to clean and preprocess data using SQL techniques and best practices, demonstrating my proficiency in SQL skills related to data cleaning, data transformation, and data quality management. The project serves as evidence of my capability to work with real-world data, identify and address data quality issues using SQL, and prepare data for analysis to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions.
